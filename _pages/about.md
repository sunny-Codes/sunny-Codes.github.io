Hi, I'm SunminðŸ‘‹. I am a Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University. 
I am fortunate enough to be advised by [Prof. Jungdam Won](https://sites.google.com/view/jungdam) and previously by [Prof. Jehee Lee](https://mrl.snu.ac.kr/~jehee/). 

I am broadly interested in understanding human movements and creating a virtual agent that moves like us. It includes, but is not limited to, character animation, machine learning and robotics.
